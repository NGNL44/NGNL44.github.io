            I grew up in a musical family. Both my parents either sing or play an instrument. This early exposure to music helped me grow my love for it. When I was 12 I started singing
            lessons. When I turned 14, I picked up my first instrument, the guitar. By the time I was 15, I uploaded my first song online and I kept making songs every now and then. Even
            though I was not the best at it, I always enjoyed having a creative outlet through it.

            I discovered video games when I was about 5 years old when my uncle brought his Playstation 2 to my house for a weekend. I vividly remember playing my first ever video 
            game which was Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (very inappropriate for a 5 year old haha). This immediately got me hooked and when I was around 14 I discovered E-Sports. I 
            am a very competitive person and I use that desire to win to get better. This trait lends itself well to when I played Counter Strike competitively for a few year. In recent 
            years, I have been involved with the NMSU E-Sports team but not to the degree that I was at when I competed.

            I am a part of Sigma Chi fraternity of the Zeta Phi chapter at New Mexico State University. The friends and connections I have made through Sigma Chi in the past two and 
            a half years are irreplacable. My favorite aspects of being in a fraternity have been the Philantrophy events. In the 2021-2022 academic year, we as a chapter raised over 
            $20,000 which is comparable to some of the bigger chapters in bigger schools. This led to our biggest achievement as a chapter yet, winning the Gold Peterson award and being
            ranked number 2 between all Sigma Chi chapters
