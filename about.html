            Hello! My name is Erlangga but most people call me Aang (like the avatar). I am currently a junior at New Mexico State University studying computer Science. 
            I am from the city of Batam in Indonesia where I grew up for the first 16 years of my life before my life changed in 2018. That year, I was selected as a 
            recipient of the KL-YES scholarship from the Department of State which allowed me to come to the United States. Since I got to the US, I have been involved 
            in many things such as being a volunteer for AFS, sports team, NMSU's E-Sport team, and Sigma Chi Fraternity
